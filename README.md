# ExpenseLog

The app stores user data in SQLite to achieve data persistance.

The class DatabaseHelper extends the SQLiteOpenHelper, which is used to manage the database.

The listview is managed by the SimpleCursorAdapter to put all infomation in database onto the listview.

The app supports deleting, adding and editing. Hold an item on to choose to
either delete or edit. Click ,up right corner to add a new item.

It is kept to a minimalist design, with only black and white.
